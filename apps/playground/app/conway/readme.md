This is a version of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life CA.

It exists to test different concepts in implementing a classic CA and to drive the design of generalising the patterns to other CA (i.e. being able to alter and influence behaviours are rules and understand different types of CA).

It is also really barebones which enables testing the design of the system to optimise for performance.
